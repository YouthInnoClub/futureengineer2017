This agricultural multitool is a combination of a small hoe, a spade, and a serrated knife. ABS plastic is durable, but not hard enough to use on plastic, so I made a tool for use on a softer material. Plants! The hoe can be used to loosen and till soil, the spade to move and dig it, and the serrated edge is for trimming and harvesting.
